This is a hands-on, project-driven, workshop-style course that explores the
frontiers of cultural, literary, and historical analysis in the information
age.

## Goals

- familiarize students with emerging paradigms of scholarship in digital
  humanities

- shape and articulate a team-based semester-long research project

- gain skills and expertise applicable widely across fields and disciplines

- understand the impact of technology on the ways we aggregate information,

- store and access data, navigate texts, and create and disseminate knowledge

- explore artistic, textual and literary activity and emerging models of

- cultural and scholarly practice “in the wild”

- integrate research across undergraduate, graduate, and faculty lines through
  collaborative, team-based hands-on work

- identify and familiarize students with large corpora of textual, sound, and
  visual materials

- pose big questions that require many minds and multiple forms of

- discipline-based expertise to solve

- generate high visibility/high impact work of potential significance to
  communities both inside and outside the university


## Course Description

How is the rapid development of global computer networks, digital media, and
massive data archives changing the way we study history and culture? We now
have access to unprecedentedly large and rich bodies of information generated
from the digitization of older materials and the explosion of new content
through social media. Machine learning and natural language processing make it
possible to answer traditional research questions with greater rigor, and
tackle new kinds of projects that would once have been deemed impracticable.
At the same time, scholars now have many more ways to communicate with one
another and the broader public, and it is becoming both easier – and more
necessary – to collaborate across disciplines.

The course aims to create a laboratory organized around a common group of
datasets, each of which can be used for multiple research projects. Students
in this course will begin by learning about earlier methodological
transformations in literary, cultural, and historical analysis, and consider
whether and how the “digital turn” might turn out differently. They will then
explore new tools and techniques, including data curation, named-entity
extraction, part-of-speech tagging, topic modeling, sentiment analysis,
machine and crowd-sourced translation, social and citation network analysis,
and text visualization. Depending on need, there will also be methodological
excursions into the fields of history, literary studies, and design.

As we turn to specific research projects, expect to form groups led by
graduate and faculty researchers, determine what you can contribute, and seek
out additional training. You will be encouraged to conduct experiments and
write research papers. But projects could also include digital editions, data
visualizations, tools for teachers and scholars, and proposals and prospecti
for large-scale and crowd-sourced research projects.

The course is open to students of all ages and at all levels of technical
skill. But they should be open to applied training on the basics of database
discovery, natural language processing, graph theory, image analysis, text
visualization, and network analysis.
